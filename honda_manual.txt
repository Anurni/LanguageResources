FUEL LINES


 
Replace any parts which show deterioration, dam- 
age or leakage. 

 


FUEL STRAINER 


Turn the fuel valve OFF. 


Remove the fuel cup, O-ring and strainer, draining 
the gasoline into a suitable container, 


W WARNING 


Gasoline is flammable and is explosive under 
certain conditions. Do not smoke or allow 
flames or sparks near the equipment while 
draining fuel. | 


| 


Wash the cup and strainer in clean nonflammable or 
high flash point solvent. 


Reinstall the screen, aligning the index marks 
on the fuel valve body and strainer. Install a new 
O-ring into the fuel’ valve body. Reinstall 
the fuel cup, making sure the new O-ring is in place, 
Hand tighten the fuel cup and torque to specifica- 
tion. ; 


TORQUE: 3-5 N-m (0.3—0.5 kg-m, 2—4 ft-lb) 


After installing the strainer and refilling the tank, 
turn the fuel valve'ON and check that there are no 
leaks.

FUEL LINE DIAPHRAGM 
REMOVAL 


Turn the fuel valve OFF. 


Remove the seat. 


Disconnect the fuel line, vacuum line and air vent 
tube. 


Remove the fuel tank. 


INSPECTION 


Place a suitable drainage container under the fuel 
line. 


Turn the fuel valve to ON. If fuel comes out of the 
fuel line, replace the fuel line diaphragm. 


Connect a vacuum gauge to the diaphragm vacuum 
outlet. Fuel should flow from the fuel line when 
12—20 mm Hg (0.48—0.8 in Hg) of vacuum is 
applied. If flow is restricted, replace the fuel line 
diaphragm. 


INSTALLATION 


Installation of the fuel line diaphragm is the reverse 
order of removal. 


NOTE 


Be sure all fuel line, vacuum line and air vent 
tube connections are tight and not leaking. 
THROTTLE OPERATION 


Check for smooth throttle grip full opening and 
automatic full closing in all steering positions. 


Lubricate the cables, if throttle operation is not 
smooth. . 


Make sure that the throttle cables are not de- 
teriorated, damaged, or kinked. 
Replace any damaged parts. 


Make sure throttle grip free play is 2-6 mm (1/8— 
1/4 in) at the throttle grip flange.

IDLE SPEED ADJUSTMENT 


NOTE 


Inspect and adjust idle speed after all other 
engine adjustments are within specifica- 


tions. | 

The engine must be warm for accurate 
idle adjustment. Ten minutes of stop- 
and-go driving is sufficient. 


Warm up the jengine, shift to NEUTRAL, and 
place the motorcycle on its center stand. 

Turn the throttle stop screw as required to obtain 
the specified idle speed.

Check the fuel tank breather tube between the tank 
cap and canister and the vacuum tube between the 
canister and purge control valve for deterioration, 
damage or loose joints or connections. Also check 
the tubes for clogging due to bending or twisting. 


Check the fuel tank sealing rubber for deterioration.

No. 4 cylinder’s spark plug wire. 


Start the engine and let it idle. 
IDLE SPEED: 1,100 + 100 rpm 


Aim the timing light at the timing mark. The “F” 
mark should align with the index mark. 


COMPRESSION TEST 


Warm up the engine. Stop the engine and remove 
all spark plugs. 


Insert the compression gauge. 


Open the throttle valves all the way and crank the 
engine with the starter motor. 


NOTE 
Crank the engine until the gauge reading 


stops rising. The maximum reading is usually 
reached within 4—7 seconds. 


COMPRESSION PRESSURE: 
1,176.8 + 98.1 kPa 
(12 + 1 kg/cm”, 170 + 14 psi) 


If compression is low, check the following: 
— Leaky valves 

— Hydraulic valve adjusters 

— Leaking cylinder head gasket 

— Worn piston/ring/cylinder 


High compression indicates that carbon deposits 
have accumulated on the combustion chamber or 
the piston crown.

battery fluid level. When the fluid level nears the 
lower level line, remove the battery as follows: 


UPPER LEVEL 


Remove the battery holder plate bolt and dis- 


connect the secondary ground cable open the 
battery plate. 


Disconnect the negative cable at the battery termi- 
nal, then remove the positive cable. 


Pull the battery out, remove the filler caps and 
add distilled water to the upper level line. 


Reinstall the filler caps and reinstall the battery. 


NOTE

acid, Protect your eyes, skin and clothing. 


If electrolyte gets in your eyes; flush them 
throughly with water and get prompt medical 
attention. 


Replace the battery, if sulfation forms or sedimants 
accumulate on the bottom. 


BRAKE FLUID 


Check the front brake fluid reservoir level. 
If the level nears the lower level mark, remove 


the cover and diaphragm. 
Fill the reservoir) with DOT—3 or DOT—4 to the

are not compatible with each other. 


BRAKE SHOE/PAD WEAR 


BRAKE PAD WEAR 
Check the brake pads for wear by looking through 


the slot indicated by the arrow cast on the caliper 
assembly. 

Replace the brake pads if the wear line on the pads 
reaches the edge of the brake disc (page 16-5). 


CAUTION 
Always replace the brake pads in pairs to 
assure even disc pressure. 


Refer to section 16 for brake bleeding procedures. 


BRAKE SHOE INSPECTION 
Replace the brake shoes if the arrow on the brake 


arm aligns with the reference mark “4” on full 
application of the rear brake pedal.
