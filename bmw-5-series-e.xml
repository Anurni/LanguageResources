      The OIL SERVICE light in the service interval indicator should be the basic guide to scheduling oil changes. The oil service light should come on at or before 7,500 miles. If the car is used primarily for short trips in slow moving traffic, or routinely operated aggressively, the oil service light should come on earlier.

      The specified maintenance intervals for replacing the air fil- ter element are based on normal use. If the car is operated pri- marily in dusty conditions, the air filter should be serviced more frequently. A dirty air filter starves the engine for air, re- ducing power output and increasing fuel consumption.

      Replacement of the V-belts every four years is recommend- ed. Loosen the mounting bolts and adjust until the belt tension is as loose as possible. Remove the belt by slipping it over the pulleys. In some cases it may be necessary to remove one V- belt to get to another. Cross section and length determine belt size. Use the old belt for comparison, or make sure that the new belt fits into the pulley groove. See Fig. 10.

      Correct tire inflation pressures are important to handling and stability, fuel economy, and tire wear. Tire pressures change with temperature. Pressures should be checked often during seasonal temperature changes. Correct inflation pres- sures can be found on the driver's door pillar and in the own- ers manual. Note that tire pressures should be higher when the car is more heavily loaded.

To remove corrosion, apply the parking brake just until it begins to grip, then pull the lever up one more stop (click), Drive the car approximately 400 meters (1,300 ft.) and re- lease the brake.

      Many different automatic transmissions are used in the cars covered by this manual, depending on engine and model year. Some early transmissions are equipped with a dipstick, while most later transmissions are not. On automatic trans- missions not equipped with a dipstick, checking the ATF level is an involved procedure that requires measuring and main- taining a specified ATF temperature during the checking pro- cedure.

Wash the car with a mixture of lukewarm water and a mild soap made expressly for washing cars. Rinse using plenty of clear water under as little pressure as possible. Wipe the body dry with a soft terry-cloth towel or chamois to prevent water- spotting.

Waxing is not needed af- ter every washing. You can tell when waxing is required by looking at the finish when it is wet. If the water coats the paint in smooth sheets instead of forming beads that roll off, a new coat of wax is needed. Wax should not be applied to black trim pieces, rubber, or other plastic parts.

      Periodic washing of the underside of the car, especially in Winter, will help prevent accumulation of road salt and rust. The best time to wash the underside is just after the car has been driven in wet conditions. Spray the chassis with a powerful jet of water. Commercial or self-service car washes may not be best for this, as they may recycle the salt-contaminated water.

    <Warning>
      Dirt spots can usually be removed with lukewarm soapy wa- ter. Use spot remover for grease and oil spots. Do not pour the liquid directly on the carpet, but dampen a clean cloth and rub carefully, starting at the edge of the spot and working inward. Do not use gasoline, naptha, or other flammable substances to clean the carpeting.

      Use a dry foam cleaner. Grease or paint spots can be re- moved by wiping with a cloth soaked with this cleaner. Use the same cleaner, applied with a soft cloth or brush, on the head- liner and side trim panels. For cloth-covered seat areas, use the techniques described previously for cleaning the carpet- ing.

    <Instruction>
      Leather upholstery and trim should be periodically cleaned using a slightly damp cotton or wool cloth. The idea is to get rid of the dirt in the creases and pores that can cause brittleness and premature aging. On heavily soiled areas, use a mild de- tergent (such as Woolite�). Use two tablespoons to one quart of cold water. Dry the trim and upholstery completely using a soft cloth. Regular use of a good quality leather conditioner will reduce drying and cracking of the leather.
